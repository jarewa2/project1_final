## `Overview`

We are ACG, a new startup consultant agency. We work with adult individuals from the ages of 16 and older. Our prime focus is in analyzing the social-economic status of each individual and advising on which employment path to take. Our goal as a company is to serve our clients, and our long-term goal is to improve on personalizing the advice on which path to take. Whether it is to go gain more education qualifications or pursue a career.

### **Reviewing applicant information:**

In order to create a cosulting plan for each of our applicants we first have to understand trends that are evident from our applcant information. Below are some of the task we completed to acheive this:

* Audit applicant information that is missing or invalid

* Re distribute applicants based on salary type



## `Questions to Solve for:`
